1.0

To rework the mod, I needed an almost clean slate, and to trim a lot of content that I feel wasn't very successful (for the amount of effort it requires).
Other things were removed because I wanted to remove them, but I couldn't because I'd ruin existing worlds (*cough* master bag)

* removed all auto pickup bags except currency bag
* removed auto salvage bag
* removed charms and bracelets
* removed map dimensions
* removed runes and runewords
* removed sets 
* removed instability

Some of these will probably come back, after a rework. Others are gone for good.
